## Project Overview

This project applies machine learning to analyze traffic accident data from the city of Tempe, Arizona, with the goal of predicting accident severity, specifically the number of injuries.
The analysis is implemented as a Python Jupyter Notebook designed to be run in Google Colab. The dataset consists of structured tabular data describing various accident-related parameters, which are used to build a regression model.
A Random Forest Regressor is used as the main modeling approach. The project focuses not only on prediction accuracy, but also on model interpretability. Decision trees are chosen as the foundation due to their interpretability, and then extended to random forests to reduce overfitting and improve robustness while retaining insight into feature importance.
This notebook serves as an example of how machine learning models can be used for causal analysis and decision support, not just prediction.

## Running the Notebook

Open the notebook in Colab and run the cells sequentially.
